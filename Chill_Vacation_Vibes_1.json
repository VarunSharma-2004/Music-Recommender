Their music, while not strictly \"lo-fi,\" often has a calm and meditative quality.\n\n2. **Bollywood Songs - Unplugged/Acoustic Versions:** Many Bollywood songs have been reimagined in unplugged or acoustic versions, which can create a more relaxed atmosphere.  Search for \"[Song Title] Unplugged\" or \"[Song Title] Acoustic\" on YouTube.\n\n3. **Sufi Music:**  Sufi music often has a spiritual and calming quality.  Artists like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan are great places to start.\n\n4. **Contemporary Indian Artists:** Look for independent artists who blend Indian instruments and melodies with electronic or downtempo elements. This is a growing area of music, and you might discover some hidden gems.\n\nI'll also keep looking for existing playlists or mixes that might fit your request.
