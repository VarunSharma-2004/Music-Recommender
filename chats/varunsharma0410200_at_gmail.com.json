I need the actual URLs to understand why they might not be working.  \n\nOnce you provide the links, I can potentially help by:\n\n* **Checking if the links themselves are correctly formatted.**  Sometimes a simple typo can break a link.\n* **Seeing if the websites are currently down.**  Websites can experience temporary outages.\n* **Suggesting alternative ways to find the information** if the links are permanently broken.\n\n\nI look forward to helping you!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "leave this, ok bye"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, bye!\n"}]
